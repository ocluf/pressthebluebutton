			Apologies I really thought I couldn't make it any clearer that you were supposed to press the
			blue button. Next time I'll try to make it extra clear. Maybe a big flashing arrow to the blue
			button would help?

		<p class="mt-10">
			It's a bit of a bummer. I had fun little stats about the button presses to show you. if only
			you had pressed that <span class="text-blue-500">blue</span> button!

		<p class="mt-10">Well better luck next time.</p>
