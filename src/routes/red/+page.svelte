			Apologies, I really thought I couldn't make it any clearer that you were supposed to press the
			blue button. Next time, I'll try to make it extra clear. Maybe a big flashing arrow pointing
			to the blue button would help?

			It's a bit of a bummer. Maybe you that the presses would be different, but equally rewarding?
			That is definitely not the case. I have fun little dynamic stats about the button presses for
			people who pressed the <span class="text-blue-500">blue</span> button. and they can freely view
			this screen as well.

		<p class="mt-10">Oh well, better luck next time!</p>
